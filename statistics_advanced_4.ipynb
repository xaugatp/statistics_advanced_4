    "   - **Applicability:** The t-test is generally used when dealing with small sample sizes (typically less than 30) and when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "   - **Formula:** The formula for a t-test involves the sample mean, the population mean (or a hypothesized mean), the sample standard deviation, and the sample size.\n",
    "   - **Example Scenario:** Suppose you want to compare the mean scores of two groups of students (Group A and Group B) on a test. You collect a sample of 20 students from each group and calculate the mean and standard deviation of their scores. To determine if there is a significant difference between the two groups, you would use a t-test.\n",

    "2. **Z-test:**\n",
    "   - **Applicability:** The z-test is typically used when dealing with large sample sizes (usually greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.\n",

    "  - **Reasoning:** Since the sample sizes are relatively small (25), and you likely don't know the population standard deviation of commute times, a t-test would be appropriate.\n",
